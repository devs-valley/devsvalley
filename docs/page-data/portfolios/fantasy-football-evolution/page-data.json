With our unique, three-stage flagship product, Fantasy Football Evolution (FFE), we believe we have set a new standard for fantasy sports, being the only company to offer a truly global fantasy football competition with the same look and feel as the traditional fantasy football that we all grew up playing.</p>\n<h3>Policy Statement Regarding Gambling</h3>\n<p>In 2006, the Federal “Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act” (UIGEA) made on-line gambling illegal in the United States. The UIGEA specifically exempted fantasy sports from this act because at the time, fantasy sports were season-long pass-times for small stakes and were clearly based on skill. However, the recent explosion of growth in 'Daily' Fantasy Sports has totally changed the industry, causing many states to legislate additional consumer protections. FFE is a 'traditional' season-long online fantasy football business. We charge a low entry fee to enter our three-stage global competition which requires players to draft a team and then play for many weeks to see if they can become the Global Champion and win a $25k annual grand prize. It is very similar in design to the traditional fantasy football that was in the mind of the drafters of the UIGEA exemption and is nothing like the intense ‘Daily’ fantasy football sites which have caused the recent negative public reaction to fantasy sports.</p>\n<p>FFE is a reputable, well-established business, recognized in the industry as being a highly strategic competition requiring great skill over many weeks of competition to win. We have had zero consumer complaints with regard to gambling or employee abuses.</p>\n<p>The ‘season-long’ fantasy sports operators are very different to the ‘Daily’ operators and we request that legislators differentiate between the two types of operators when framing protective consumer legislation.</p>\n<p>We take our legal and social responsibilities very seriously and are committed to remaining in full compliance of all federal and state laws.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Fantasy football evolution","date":"2019-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","projectLink":"https://fantasyfootballevolution.com/","technologies":["PUG","SCSS","ES6","GULP","PHP","Codeigniter","Apache","TweenMax","Bootstrap"],"client":{"name":"DevDec","logo":"https://devdec.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/logo-header.svg","url":"https://devdec.ca/"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"portfolios","slug":"fantasy-football-evolution"}}}
